# Daily loop

1. **~10:00** optional Reddit AI meta (culture heat)
2. **~11:00** start X watchlist scrape (browser, read-only)
3. **Keyword / pattern pass** on watchlist hits + ~20 outsider AI posts from last ~48h (recurring phrases, names, structures)
4. **Draft engine** writes EN drafts + `video_tip` **from** that pattern brief
5. **≤12:00** deliver digest to the operator chat
6. Operator picks 1-2 angles, edits drafts, publishes manually
7. Optional builders (HTML / video) only when a hook deserves pixels
8. Refresh **the operator's personal** X Virality Score board (`board/data.json`) — X Score + Day Target — then push to **their** GitHub Pages URL (never the shared demo by default)

## Editing the watchlist

Open `config/watchlist.json` (create it from `config/watchlist.example.json` if needed) and replace handles with whoever is actually viral in **your** niche. Save. Next run uses the new list. No code change required. The real watchlist and `board/data.json` are gitignored.

## Your board

See `board/SETUP.md` and `docs/marketplace-first-run.md`. Demo board is example-only: https://monkeyteamvip.github.io/kiosa-board/

## Privacy note
